# Positioning-Household-Blenders-in-the-Market-using-Perceptual-Maps

## Background

Positioning is defined as placing the product or service in the mind of a prospect customer. To position companies in markets, one must differentiate the company and ensure customers acknowledge that difference. For example, when an individual thinks of "overnight shiping", they might think of the popular shipping firm FedEx (fedex.com), Similarly, they could Johnson & Johnson brand Band-Aid with "adhesive bandage." Companies spend significant resources to achieve this positioning. It is not enough to be different, although differentiation is a prerequisite for positioning.

Perceptual mapping graphically represents customers' perceptions of important attributes of areas of interest for marketers, such as product or service categories and brands. The maps show us the "position" of products and services in the customer's mind. Two-dimensional perceptual maps use the x and y axes to denote the two primary purchasing criteria consumers consider when buying a product or service.

In the case of blenders, consumers evaluate blenders (within a given price range) by considering feature availability and blending power.

Perceptual Map and Positioning: Perceptual Map: Position new or existing product or service.
Process: Search existing literature for background on market. Conduct market research survey to
determine most important evaluation criteria. Conduct another survey to assess how competitors
perform against those criteria. Build perceptual map and interpret it.

Figure 3.37 shows a simple example of a two-dimensional perceptual map for household
blenders. Two-dimensional perceptual maps use the x and y axes to denote the two primary
purchasing criteria consumers consider when buying a product or service. In the case of
blenders, the figure shows that consumers evaluate blenders (within a given price range) by
considering feature availability and blending power.
Brands shown far to the right (along the x axis) on the graph are perceived as having more
features than those on the left. Brands shown near the top of the graph (along the y axis) are
